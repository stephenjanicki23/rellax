# Deployment

The app is a standard Next.js 16 server application. It needs a Node runtime — it is not
a static site, because rosters, projections and every recommendation are computed
server-side and the ESPN cookies must never reach the browser.

Two supported paths: **Vercel** (simplest) and **any container host** (Fly, Railway,
Render, Cloud Run, your own box).

---

## Before you deploy: the password gate

This app has no user accounts yet. A deployed instance holds your ESPN session cookies
server-side, so anyone who found the URL could read your league. `src/middleware.ts`
enforces this rather than trusting you to remember:

| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | `ESPN_S2` / `ESPN_SWID` | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| not set | not set | Open. This is local development against sample data. |
| not set | **set** | **Refuses to serve (503)** and explains why. |
| set | either | HTTP Basic auth on every page and API route. |

So: **set `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` on any deployment that has ESPN credentials.** Any username
works at the prompt; the password is the secret.

Replace this with real authentication when accounts land (PROJECT_PLAN.md, phase 7).

---

## Option A — Vercel

The app lives in a subdirectory, so the root directory must be set.

**Dashboard**
1. New Project → import `stephenjanicki23/rellax`.
2. Set **Root Directory** to `fantasy-football`. Framework auto-detects as Next.js.
3. Add environment variables (below) under Settings → Environment Variables.
4. Deploy.

**CLI**
```bash
cd fantasy-football
npx vercel link          # choose the project; set root directory to this folder
npx vercel env add DASHBOARD_PASSWORD production
npx vercel env add ESPN_LEAGUE_ID production
npx vercel env add ESPN_SEASON production
npx vercel env add ESPN_S2 production
npx vercel env add ESPN_SWID production
npx vercel env add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY production   # optional
npx vercel --prod
```

`vercel.json` already sets `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and a restrictive `Permissions-Policy`, so the
deployment will not be indexed or framed.

---

## Option B — Container

`next.config.ts` sets `output: 'standalone'`, so the runtime image carries a
self-contained server bundle rather than the whole `node_modules` tree.

```bash
cd fantasy-football
docker build -t ffo:latest .

docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DASHBOARD_PASSWORD='choose-something-long' \
  -e ESPN_LEAGUE_ID=123456 \
  -e ESPN_SEASON=2026 \
  -e ESPN_S2='...' \
  -e ESPN_SWID='{...}' \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='...' \
  ffo:latest
```

The image runs as a non-root user and bakes in no credentials — everything is supplied at
runtime. It works unchanged on Fly (`fly launch --dockerfile Dockerfile`), Railway,
Render, or Cloud Run.

To run the standalone bundle without Docker:

```bash
npm ci && npm run build
cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/static
cp -r public .next/standalone/public
cd .next/standalone && PORT=3000 node server.js
```

## Environment variables

All server-side. None is exposed to the browser; there is no `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` secret.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | For any deploy with ESPN credentials | HTTP Basic password gate |
| `ESPN_LEAGUE_ID` | For real data | Your league id |
| `ESPN_SEASON` | For real data | e.g. `2026` |
| `ESPN_S2`, `ESPN_SWID` | Private leagues | Session cookies — see ESPN_INTEGRATION.md |
| `ESPN_TEAM_ID` | Optional | Which ESPN team is yours |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional | Narrative AI analysis; without it the deterministic engine analysis is used |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | Optional | Defaults to `claude-sonnet-5` |
| `LEAGUE_PROVIDER` | Optional | `espn` \| `manual` \| `sample`. Defaults to `espn` when a league id is present, else `sample` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Optional | PostgreSQL. Not yet required — persistence is phase 7 |

With none of these set the app boots on the labelled synthetic sample league, which is a
safe way to share a demo link: there are no real credentials and no real player data.

## Notes

- **ESPN cookies expire** (roughly annually, sooner if you log out everywhere). The app
  surfaces `AUTH_EXPIRED` rather than silently showing empty rosters — refresh the cookies
  and redeploy the env var when that happens.
- **No database is required** for the app to run. Every screen recomputes from the
  provider on request. Historical tracking and Front Office grading need `DATABASE_URL`,
  and that wiring is not built yet.
- **Cold starts**: pages are `force-dynamic` because every number depends on live roster
  state. On Vercel's serverless functions expect a second or two on a cold path.
